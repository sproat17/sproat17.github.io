# Project 2: Personal Magic Mirror

## For a C:

### Initial Screen

The sketch shows what the user will see when walking in front of the mirror. The displayed options include all general information buttons, as well as a button to open a new health window, and more buttons for advanced features. In this sketch, it is presumed that the user has clicked the weather button.

### News

Current news topics are constantly displayed at the bottom of the screen. It was intended for the articles to cycle after a set amount of time. This was moved in favor of a forward and backward button in the final implementation.

### Advanced Features

The advanced features are separated to the middle right side of the screen. This is so you can focus on the more heavily used buttons. They can be accessed by pressing the settings button.

### Health Window

When the health button has clicked a screen resembling this one will be displayed on top of the mirror.

### Calendar Window

The calendar highlights the current date and also highlights other days that may be important for the user.

## For a B:

### Discussion

The display largely follows the suggested sketch from part A. But there are a few changes. 

### At startup

At startup, there is nothing displayed except a power button. This is done to ensure the full functionality that a mirror should have. The settings button for advanced features also toggles the display of the advanced feature buttons as these will be less used than the button for general information. 

In the implementation, the time has been moved to the top right of the screen. The settings and notifications have been moved to the top left of the screen next to the power button.

#### Notifications

The notifications icon will be red if there are unread notifications. After reading the notifications the notifications button will resemble all other buttons. 

#### After clicking the power button

#### After clicking the settings button

### News

The news is still constantly displayed at the ticker, however, you can manually cycle between current news and also filter the news to your preferences. 

### Weather

The number of days that the weather button displays are extended to show the entire week of weather. The heading text was removed as they were redundant and can be easily understood without the clutter.

### Health window 

The health window can calculate a health score, and after clicking on the scale button a graph is created with weekly weight fluctuations.
