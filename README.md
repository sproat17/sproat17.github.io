## For a B:

### Discussion

The display largley follows the suggested sketch from part A. But there are a few changed. 

### At startup

At startup there nothing displayed except a power button. This is done to ensure full functionality that a mirtror should have. The settings button for advanced featrures also toggles the displayu of the advamced feature buttons as thease will be less used that the buttoin for genaral information. 

In the implemetation, the time has been moved to the top right of the screen. The settings and notifcations has been moved to the top left of the screen next to the power button.

### News

The news is still constantly displayed at the ticker, however you can manually cycle between current news and also filter the nwes to your prefrences. 

### Weather

The amount of days that weather button displays are exteneded to show the entire week of weather. The heading text was removed as they were redundat and can be easily understood without the clutter.
